<ul class="info">
	<li>In most of our projects we download a svn repo to a folder in our PCs. This folder can be everywhere, that's why we map it to a specific letter.
	The idea is that everybody works inside this mapped drive, so that all paths point to a specific letter.</li>

	<li>Unfortunately sometimes paths have been specified to the svn folder instead of the mapped folder. This results in paths missing
	when a max file is opened in another PC.</li>
	
	<li>This script gathers all the missing or incorrect paths and attempts to fix them so that they point to the mapped drive. It also works with GL_Effect materials.
	Those paths that have not been fixed automatically can be fixed manually through the "Asset Tracker" dialog.</li>
