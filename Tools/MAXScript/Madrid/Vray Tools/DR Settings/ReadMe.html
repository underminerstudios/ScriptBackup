<ul class="info">
<li>This tool will allow you to manage the nodes that you are going to use in the distributed rendering.</li>

<li>You will see a list of all the PCs that are online in the local network. The checked ones will be the ones used by vray.
If you checked a PC that doesn't have the spawner or isn't even on, worry not! Vray will skip it when rendering.</li>

<li>The "Check for Spawners" button is quite slow. It will check if the spawner is running on the PCs. After it's done checking the computers will get two different colors. "Red" if the spawner has not been found. "Green" if it has been found.
This tool will allow you to spot PCs that have the spawner running that you weren't aware of! But if you see that all the PCs are marked "red" you might have to increase the "timeout" value. Is the amount of time (in seconds) that the tool will wait for a response, depending on the network status you might have to increase this up to 1.2.</li>

<li>You can leave the other values as they are.

<li>Clicking on "OK" will save the settings persistently. Next time you open 3dsMax these values will be preserved. You can go back any time to this tool and check for new spawners.</li>
