<ul class="info">
<li>This tool will help you setup the spawner on your PC, just check the "Run on Windows Startup" checkbox and edit your settings.
It is quite self-explanatory:</li>

    <li>Low Priority will change the priority to low. I recommend turning it on.</li>
    <li>Change Affinity will allow you to specify which cores will be used by the spawner. Core0 will always be used. I recommend checking all but one. You will probably not even notice that your PC is being used with these settings.</li>

<li>Finally click "Save". From now on the spawner will launch everytime you run Windows. If you want to turn it off, or change the settings go back to this window and change them and click "Save".</li>
