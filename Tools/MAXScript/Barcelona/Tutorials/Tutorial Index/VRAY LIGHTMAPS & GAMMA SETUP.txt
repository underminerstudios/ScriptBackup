[VRAY: LIGHTMAPS & GAMMA SETUP]
-------------------------------
There are few steps that you should set BEFORE setting any light in your scene.
To keep the things simple we will focus on the easiest technique (not the best, but the easiest) to work with proper gamma 2.2 and VRAY.

Before doing anything, go to: [Rendering]->[Gamma/LUT setup], and disable everything.

1) Open the render setup dialog and open the [V-RAY] tab and expand the [V-RAY::Color mapping] rollout.
2) Set the gamma as 2.2. Maintain checked only the [Linear workflow] and the [Clamp output] options.
3) If you want to set a more filmic looking set the "Type" as [Reinhard]

Beside this, I recommend you to use [irrandiance map] + [light cache] to bake your lightmaps (specially if they belongs to an indoor scenario).
For more information about V-Ray render quality setups check the [VRAY: RENDER QUALITY] tutorial.
