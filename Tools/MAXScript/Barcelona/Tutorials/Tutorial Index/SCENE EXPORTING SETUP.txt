[SCENE EXPORTING SETUP]
--------------------------
Ok, I have my scene done and I want to export everything to CLARA...
What should I do?

1) DIRECTX TRANSLATOR:
If you're using some of our Custom-DirectX materials (DX-terrain-material or DX-asphalt-material) you should use this script first of all.
Transform the DirectX Mats using the [DIRECTX to VRAY] option. (You can ignore this step if you're not using DirectX mats at all).

2) VRAY TRANSLATOR:
Then, we need to be sure that all the scene materials are STANDAR materials only. (MultiSubObject Materials with STANDAR materials are allowed too).
Transform the materials using the [VRAY to STANDAR] option.

3) BUMPMAP REPLACER:
After that, we need to be sure that all the bumpmaps used in the scene are set as NORMALBUMPS.
Transform all the scene bumpmaps checking the [STANDAR_BUMP] option.

4) TERRAIN MIX TRANSLATOR:
Finally, if you have been using vertex-color-blend to mix different texture channels (using the DX-terrain-material or DX-asphalt-material) you should translate all those RGB channels to the proper CLARA structure inside a Standar material.
To do this we will use the [TERRAIN MIX TRANSLATOR] (You can ignore this if you didn't use this technique)

If everything has gone ok, now you should be able to export the scene to clara without problems.
