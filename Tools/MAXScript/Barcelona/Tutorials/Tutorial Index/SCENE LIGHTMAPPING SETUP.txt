[SCENE LIGHTMAPPING SETUP]
--------------------------
Ok, I have my scene done and I want to bake some lightmaps with VRAY...
What should I do?

1) DIRECTX TRANSLATOR:
If you're using some of our Custom-DirectX materials (DX-terrain-material or DX-asphalt-material) you should use this script first of all.
Transform the DirectX Mats using the [DIRECTX to VRAY] option. (You can ignore this step if you're not using DirectX mats at all).

2) VRAY TRANSLATOR:
Then, we need to be sure that all the scene materials are VRAY materials only. (MultiSubObject Materials with VRAY materials are allowed too).
Transform the materials using the [STANDARD to VRAY] option.

3) BUMPMAP REPLACER:
Finally we need to be sure that all the bumpmaps used in the scene are set as NORMALBUMPS.
Transform all the scene bumpmaps checking the [NORMAPLBUMP] option.

If everything has gone ok, now you should be able to render the scene lightmaps without problems.
