[VRAY: RENDER QUALITY]
----------------------
Before doing anything of the following steps I recommend you to set your GAMMA SETUP to 2.2 as it is indicate in the [VRAY: LIGHTMAPS & GAMMA SETUP] tutorial.
Once you did this we can start configuring the V-RAY render setup:

1) Open the render setup dialog and open the [IndirectIllumination] tab.
2) Expand the [V-Ray:: Indirect Illumnination (GI)] rollout and enable the it.
3) Change the secondary bounces to [Lightcache]

DRAFT Setup (Fast):
1) Expand the [V-Ray::Irradiance map] rollout:
2) Set the current preset to [Custom]
3) In the "basic parameters" set the [min rate] and the [max rate] to: -3. Check the [show calc. phase] too.
4) Expand the [V-Ray::Light cache] rollout:
5) Set the [subdivs:] to 250 and the [number of passes] to 8. Check the [show calc. phase] too.
6) Now open the [Settings] tab and open the [V-Ray::DMC sampler]:
7)Set the [Min Samples] to 4 and the [Global subdivs multiplier] to 1.0

QUALITY Setup (Slow):
1) Expand the [V-Ray::Irradiance map] rollout:
2) Set the current preset to [Custom]
3) In the "basic parameters" set the [min rate] to: -3 and the [max rate] to: 0. Check the [show calc. phase] too.
4) Expand the [V-Ray::Light cache] rollout:
5) Set the [subdivs:] to 1000 and the [number of passes] to 16. Set the [Sample size] to 0.01. Check the [show calc. phase] too.
6) Now open the [Settings] tab and open the [V-Ray::DMC sampler]:
7)Set the [Min Samples] to 32 and the [Global subdivs multiplier] to 1.2

There are a lot of other variables that can change radically the quality and time spent in your renders (HDRI, photometric lights, VRay lights, material complexities...).
My advice to keep everything simple and under control can be resumed in this 4 simple sentences:
1) Do not use photometric lights or physical cameras (Unless you don't know perfectly how they work. They tend to mess the things quite quickly).
2) Use always VrayShadows (not shadowmaps or anything else!)
3) Do not use VrayLights unless you know EXACTLY what are you doing. They are formidable CPU/Render-Time eaters.
