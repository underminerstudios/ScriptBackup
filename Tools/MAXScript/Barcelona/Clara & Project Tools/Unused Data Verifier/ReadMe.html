<b>DESCRIPTION:</b>
<ul class="info">
	<li>This script will allow you to check for potentially unused data assets on an entire project folder. This means identify all the unused DAE files and TGA files inside a project.</li>
	<li><b>VERY IMPORTANT:</b> Due the nature of the script and the amount of assets in some projects, it can take A LOT of time to parse an entire project. I recommend you to run the script when you are not busy with your computer (as sintance before you leave the office) Be patient, finally the list will appear.</li>	
</ul>
<b>INSTRUCTIONS:</b>
<ul class="info">
	<li>Set the [Gfx3D] folder of the project.</li>
	<li>Set the [Levels] folder of the project.</li>
	<li>Set the [States] folder of the project.</li>
	<li>Press [search unused assets].</li>
</ul>
<b>KNOWN ISSUES:</b>
<ul class="info">
	<li>After deleteing the neecesary unused DAE files, it si recomendable to run the script again. Probably the script will be able too find more unused textures (those textures that were used only by those deleted DAE files.)</li>
</ul>
